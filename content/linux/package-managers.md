Invertigar Interfaces

Most snaps use strict confinement to isolate both their execution environments
and their data from your system (see Snap Confinement for further details).
A confined snap that needs user-access to files will most likely use the home
interface to bridge this confinement gap, allowing you to save and load files
from your home directory automatically.
